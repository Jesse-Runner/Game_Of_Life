# Game_of_Life
Sequential and Parallel implementations of Conway's Game of Life

Sequential Version:

In the sequential version of this program, we simply use a series of if statements to check the status of neighboring cells.

Parallel Version:

Our parallel version attempts to gain some speed-up by way of using Pthreading.
